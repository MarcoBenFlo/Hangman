This Java application implements a console-based version of the classic word-guessing game Hangman. Players attempt to guess a hidden word letter-by-letter or by guessing the entire word at once. The game provides a variety of categories and randomly selects words from predefined lists.
Features
20 Word Categories: Includes categories such as Movies, Books, Star Wars, Countries, Elements, Animals, Food, and Computer Science Vocabulary.
Random Word Selection: Each game randomly selects a word from the chosen category.
Lives System: Players have 16 lives per game. Incorrect guesses incrementally draw the hangman figure.
Guessing Options: Players can guess individual letters or attempt to guess the entire word at any time by entering the "!" character.
Console Interface: Clear text-based interface displaying instructions, current progress (dashes and correctly guessed letters), and visual hangman representation.
Gameplay Instructions
Launch the program and follow the on-screen prompts.
Choose a category by entering its corresponding number (1-20).
Guess letters individually or enter "!" to guess the entire word.
Monitor your progress displayed as dashes (-) for unknown letters.
Win by correctly guessing all letters or lose if you exhaust all 16 lives.
